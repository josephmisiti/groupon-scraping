##### *********** THIS PROJECT IS DEPRICATED ****************

I'm not longer no longer using this, Groupon also sucks. Fork at your own will.

These scripts were develop to scrape the "recent deals" section of the www.groupon.com.
I was interested in looking at some of the price information per city and running some analytics
on it.

The script GrouponScraper.py relies on Beautiful Soup for all HTML parsing.
